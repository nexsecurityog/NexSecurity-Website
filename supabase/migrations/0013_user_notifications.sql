-- An in-app notification inbox, separate from push_subscriptions
-- (0008). Push delivery only reaches a device that both supports the
-- Push API AND has an active subscription — iOS Safari outside an
-- installed, standalone PWA doesn't support it at all, and any device
-- can have permission denied/revoked. This table is what makes "a new
-- class/ebook/routine went up" visible inside the app itself (the bell
-- icon in TopNav.tsx) regardless of whether push ever reached that
-- device — push and this inbox are two independent delivery paths for
-- the exact same event, not one built on top of the other.
--
-- One row per (recipient, event) — same shape as push_subscriptions
-- being one row per (user, device) rather than a shared row with a
-- join table; simpler to query "my unread notifications" as a single
-- indexed lookup with no join.
-- public.is_admin() is only ever defined in supabase/schema.sql (for a
-- FRESH install) — it was never shipped as its own migration, so any
-- project that's only ever run migrations (not the full schema.sql)
-- doesn't have it yet. Defining it here too (idempotent — same as
-- schema.sql's own "create or replace") makes this migration
-- self-contained instead of silently depending on a function that
-- might not exist yet.
