 * VideoPlayer.tsx gets its playback URL from the Worker
 * (worker/src/index.ts) via app/api/video/[id]/stream-token/route.ts
 * instead. Its actual byte-streaming workload — the reason it existed —
 * now runs at Cloudflare's edge instead of on Vercel. Safe to delete in
 * a later cleanup pass once the migration's been confirmed stable in
 * production; left untouched here on purpose.
 *
 * Streams an admin-configured .m3u8 (HLS) playlist and its segments to an
 * authorized viewer, attaching the Referer header the source CDN requires
 * — a header browsers block client-side JS from setting itself (see
 * lib/m3u8.ts), so this proxy is the only place it can actually be
 * attached. The raw source URL and Referer never reach the client:
 * VideoPlayer.tsx only ever gives hls.js this route's own same-origin URL.
 *
 *   GET /api/video/[id]/hls-proxy            -> the root playlist
 *   GET /api/video/[id]/hls-proxy?u=<token>  -> a sub-resource the root

/**
 * DISABLED — this route used to be the m3u8 playback path before the
 * Cloudflare Worker offload (worker/src/index.ts), and was left in
 * place afterward as dead-code reference on the assumption that nothing
 * in this app links to it anymore. That assumption was WRONG in the way
 * that actually matters: "nothing in THIS APP links to it" only means
 * the frontend never constructs this URL — it says nothing about
 * whether the route itself still runs, and it did. A valid session
 * cookie was the ONLY thing this route ever checked; it has none of the
 * IP-binding (lib/streamToken.ts's `ip` field), short TTL, or
 * burst-detection the Worker path enforces on every single request. Any
 * authorized account's own active session could hit
 * `/api/video/[id]/hls-proxy` directly — no signed token, no expiry
 * beyond the session itself — and get an unthrottled, unbound proxy
 * stream for any video whose id it knew. That gap is what this whole
 * feature's worth of hardening (concurrent-session caps, IP binding,
 * auto-block) was built to close on the Worker path, and none of it
 * applied here because this route predates all of it and was never
 * updated or removed.
 *
 * Kept as a file (not deleted outright) so the parsing/rewriting logic
 * above stays available for reference — but the route itself now refuses
 * every request. If this ever needs to come back for a real reason, it
 * MUST be rebuilt on the same token/IP-binding model as
 * worker/src/index.ts, never re-enabled as-is.
