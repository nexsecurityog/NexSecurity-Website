# NexSecurity

A private learning platform. Nothing is visible to anyone who isn't on the
server-side allowlist — not a page, not an API response, not a video URL.

Stack: **Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript, Supabase (Postgres + Auth +
Storage), deployed on Vercel.**

Why this stack for this brief: Supabase gives us Google OAuth, session
management, and — critically — **Postgres Row-Level Security**, so
authorization is enforced by the database itself, not just by application
code that a future bug could bypass. Next.js Server Components and Route
Handlers mean every protected read happens on the server, where the
service-role key and RLS-scoped queries live; the browser never holds
anything that decides access.

---

## 1. Setup

### 1.1 Supabase

1. **New project (first setup):** Open your project → **SQL Editor** →
   paste and run `supabase/schema.sql`. This creates every table fresh with
   all current columns, so no further migration step is needed.

   **Existing project (pulling new changes):** `schema.sql` uses
   `create table if not exists`, which does nothing to a table that already
   exists — it will **not** add columns that were added to an existing
   table after your project was first set up. After pulling repo changes,
   also run any new files under `supabase/migrations/` (in order, once
   each) in the SQL Editor, or your inserts may start failing with a
   generic "Could not create ___" error in the admin panel while the real
   cause (a missing column) stays hidden in the server logs.
2. **Authentication → Providers → Google**: paste your Google Client ID and
   Client Secret **here**, in the Supabase dashboard — not in this repo's
   env vars. Supabase handles the OAuth exchange.
3. **Authentication → URL Configuration**: set the Site URL to
   `https://nexsecurity.vercel.app` and add
   `https://nexsecurity.vercel.app/auth/callback` (and your local dev URL,
   e.g. `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`) to Redirect URLs.
4. **Storage — `thumbnails` bucket** (used by the admin panel's upload
   button for board/class thumbnails): create a bucket named
   `thumbnails` and toggle **Public bucket** on when creating it. This is
   deliberately public — thumbnails are preview images, not protected
   content.
5. Add yourself as the first admin:
   ```sql
   insert into public.authorized_users (email, role, status)
   values ('you@example.com', 'ADMIN', 'ACTIVE');
   ```

### 1.2 Bunny Stream (video/"class" playback)

Classes are added in `/admin/videos` by pasting a Bunny embed URL like
`https://iframe.mediadelivery.net/embed/503487/df2a65b4-…`. No extra Bunny
dashboard configuration is required — the app plays the embed directly.

**What this does and doesn't protect:** the video page itself is fully
gated by the app's normal login/authorization check — an unauthenticated
or non-allowlisted user can never reach `/learn/video/:id` or get a
playback URL from the API at all. What it does *not* do is stop an
already-authorized member from copying the embed URL out of DevTools and
sharing it — that copied link would keep working indefinitely, since
there's no expiry or domain restriction on it. If that matters later,
Bunny's Token Authentication + Allowed Referrers (in Stream Library →
Security) can be added back to `app/api/video/[id]/play/route.ts` to
close that gap — just say the word.

### 1.2.1 Bunny download links (optional)

`/admin/videos` and the class page also support auto-generated,
resolution-picker download links (no manual per-class link needed) — see
`lib/bunny.ts`. This needs 4 more env vars, all server-side only:

```
BUNNY_STREAM_API_KEY            Stream API key (dashboard → Stream → API)
BUNNY_PULL_ZONE_HOSTNAME         e.g. vz-xxxxx.b-cdn.net, no https://
BUNNY_TOKEN_AUTH_ENABLED         "true" if the pull zone has Token Authentication on
BUNNY_TOKEN_AUTH_SECURITY_KEY    only needed if the above is "true"
```

Without these set, the Download button silently falls back to a class's
manually-set `download_url` (if any), or hides itself — nothing breaks.

### 1.3 Google Cloud Console

In your OAuth client's **Authorized redirect URIs**, add your Supabase
callback URL (found on the Supabase Google provider settings page — it
looks like `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`), not your
app's own `/auth/callback` — Supabase sits in front of Google, then
forwards to your app.

**Rotate your client secret before using it** if it has ever been pasted
anywhere outside the Google Cloud Console / Supabase dashboard (chat, a
ticket, a doc, etc.) — treat any such exposure as a live leak.

### 1.4 Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for development, and set the same
keys in Vercel's Project Settings → Environment Variables for production.
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` must **never** get a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

### 1.5 Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Deploy: push to GitHub, import into Vercel, set the env vars, deploy.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.0 Public vs. private surface

By request, `/` is now a **public marketing/landing page** (original copy,
no login required) — think of it as the "storefront." Everything that
matters is still fully private:

- `/learn`, `/learn/board/:id`, `/learn/video/:id`, `/admin`, and every
  `/api/*` route are unchanged — still gated by `getAuth()` /
  `requireAuthorized()` / `requireAdmin()` exactly as before.
- `middleware.ts` now treats `/` as public alongside `/login` and the
  auth callback routes — this is still just a UX redirect layer, not a
  security boundary; the real enforcement is server-side per route as
  described below.
- The landing page's copy, stats, and reviews are placeholders — swap
  `STATS`, `PATHS`, and `REVIEWS` in `app/page.tsx` for real numbers and
  real member reviews once you have them.

```
Google OAuth (via Supabase Auth)
        |
Supabase session cookie (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax - set by @supabase/ssr)
        |
middleware.ts - refreshes the session cookie, UX-level redirect only
        |
Server Component / Route Handler calls lib/auth.ts -> getAuth()
        |
  1. Re-validates the session server-side (auth.getUser(), not just reading the cookie)
  2. Looks up the verified email in `authorized_users` (RLS-scoped: a user can only
     read their own row)
  3. Returns UNAUTHENTICATED / UNAUTHORIZED / AUTHORIZED{role}
        |
Only on AUTHORIZED does the route query protected data - and even then,
every query runs through Postgres RLS as a second, independent check.
```

**Every** protected page and API route calls `getAuth()` / `requireAuthorized()`
/ `requireAdmin()` itself. Nothing is inherited from a parent route or
cached client-side. Reaching `/learn` proves nothing about whether a
later request to `/admin` or `/api/video/:id/play` will succeed.

### 2.1 Session security

- Sessions are managed by Supabase Auth via `@supabase/ssr`, stored in
  **HttpOnly** cookies — never readable by JavaScript, never in
  localStorage/sessionStorage.
- `Secure` and `SameSite=Lax` are applied automatically by the Supabase
  cookie helper in production (HTTPS).
- `middleware.ts` refreshes the session token on every request and lets
  Supabase handle expiry/rotation.
- Logout (`supabase.auth.signOut()`) invalidates the session and clears
  the cookie — protected routes stop working immediately after.
- The OAuth callback route re-validates authorization **after** Supabase
  creates the authenticated session, and calls `signOut()` immediately if
  the email isn't on the allowlist — so an unauthorized Google account
  never ends up with a usable app session, even momentarily.
- CSRF: `SameSite=Lax` cookies plus the fact that all mutating routes
  require a valid session are the primary defense; there's no
  cookie-only authentication path that a cross-site form could exploit.

### 2.2 Why RLS, not just app-code checks

Every table in `supabase/schema.sql` has RLS **enabled with no default
access** — a table gets a policy or it's unreadable, full stop. This means
even if an application-layer bug skipped an authorization check somewhere,
the database itself would still refuse the query. `videos` in particular
has **no** SELECT policy for regular users at all — the only way to reach
video metadata or a playback URL is through the two server routes that
explicitly re-check authorization and use the service-role key, by design.

### 2.3 Protected video playback

```
User opens /learn/video/:id
        |
Server Component checks auth, fetches METADATA ONLY (title/description)
  via the service-role client (RLS blocks normal reads of `videos`),
  confirms the owning board is published
        |
Client <VideoPlayer> mounts, POSTs to /api/video/:id/play
        |
Route re-checks auth + rate limit + board-published, then builds the
plain Bunny embed URL from the stored library/video id
        |
<iframe> plays the embed URL
```

The raw `source_ref` is never sent to the client directly — not in the
board list, not in page source — it's only ever read server-side to
construct the embed URL, which is then returned in the `/play` response
right before the iframe mounts.

**By request, this is deliberately the simple version:** the embed URL
has no expiry and no domain restriction, so an authorized member could
copy it from DevTools and it would keep working elsewhere. What *is*
still fully enforced is who can reach this endpoint at all — you must be
authenticated, on the allowlist, and the board must be published, or the
route never returns a URL in the first place. If copy-paste sharing
between authorized members becomes a real problem later, Bunny's Token
Authentication + Allowed Referrers can be reintroduced in
`app/api/video/[id]/play/route.ts` — the code that did this was removed,
not deleted from institutional memory, so it's a small change to bring
back.

### 2.4 IDOR protection

`/learn/board/[id]` and `/api/boards/[id]`:
1. Validate the ID is a well-formed UUID before querying.
2. Query through RLS, which only returns the row if it's published (or the
   caller is an admin).
3. Treat "unpublished" and "doesn't exist" identically — both return a
   generic not-found — so the response can't be used to enumerate content
   ids or infer which boards exist.

Changing `/learn/board/123` to `/learn/board/124` gets you either that
board's actual published content (if you're authorized) or an identical
"not found," never a peek at something you shouldn't see.

### 2.5 Admin authorization

`requireAdmin()` checks the role from `authorized_users`, read
server-side — never from a client-supplied value. `/admin` is gated in
`app/admin/layout.tsx`, and independently, every `/api/admin/*` route
re-checks `requireAdmin()` itself, so there's no route reachable only
because the layout happened to render.

### 2.6 Rate limiting

`lib/rateLimit.ts` throttles auth callbacks, admin mutations, and video
playback-token issuance. It's an in-memory sliding window — fine for
moderate traffic and as defense-in-depth, but **not** shared across
serverless instances/regions. For real production load, swap in Upstash
Redis + `@upstash/ratelimit` (same function signature, different backing
store) — noted directly in that file.

### 2.7 Audit logging

`lib/audit.ts` records `LOGIN_SUCCESS`, `LOGIN_DENIED`, user and board
mutations, and video access grants/denials into `audit_logs`, readable
only by admins. No secrets or tokens are logged — just who did what to
which resource, when.

### 2.8 Per-account IP/device restriction

Solves account-sharing (one login used by several people at once), not
just theft. Every authorized request records a `(ip_address,
device_label)` "sighting" for that user in `device_sightings`
(`device_label` is OS+browser from the User-Agent — real hardware model
isn't exposed to websites, so this is a practical proxy, not literal
device fingerprinting). An admin reviews sightings at
`/admin/users/[id]` and Approves or Restricts each one into
`user_devices`; approving (or restricting) the first one for an account
turns `authorized_users.restrict_devices` on automatically — from then
on, only combos with `status = 'authorized'` pass `getAuth()`, anything
else (including a never-seen combo) is `DEVICE_BLOCKED`.

This is re-checked on a timer, not just at login: `<VideoPlayer>` re-hits
`/api/video/[id]/play` roughly every 4 minutes while a class is open
(without disrupting a still-valid session), so revoking a device cuts an
**already-open tab's** playback within minutes — not just future page
loads. See `lib/auth.ts`, `lib/requestInfo.ts`, and
`supabase/migrations/0003_device_restrictions.sql` /
`0004_device_status_label.sql`.

### 2.9 Content areas: E-Books & Routines

Two more per-board content types alongside classes, both admin-managed
in `/admin/ebooks` and the Boards admin (board `type = routine`):

- **E-Books** — a board can list downloadable books (`e_books` table,
  same "no public SELECT, server-route-only" RLS pattern as `videos`).
  Aggregated across all published boards at `/learn/ebooks`.
- **Routines** — a board can instead just BE a single 16:9 image (a
  class schedule/routine graphic) with a title/description, no video
  hierarchy underneath. Aggregated at `/learn/routines`.

### 2.10 Android app (Trusted Web Activity)

See §6 below — the Android app is a thin Chrome-based wrapper, not a
separate codebase; it has no auth logic of its own; every request still
goes through the exact same server-side checks described above.

---

## 3. Threat model & mitigations

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Unauthorized user reaches protected pages | Server-side `getAuth()` on every page; RLS blocks data even if a check were missed |
| Direct URL access to boards/pages/videos/admin | Server re-validates on every route; middleware redirect is UX-only, not the real gate |
| IDOR (ID enumeration/tampering) | UUID validation + RLS-scoped queries + generic not-found responses |
| Session theft | HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite cookies, no tokens in localStorage, short-lived signed URLs limit blast radius |
| CSRF | SameSite=Lax cookies; state-changing routes require a valid session, not just a cookie replay |
| XSS | React's default escaping; strict CSP in `next.config.js`; no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` anywhere |
| SQL/NoSQL injection | All queries go through the Supabase client (parameterized); all admin input validated with Zod before it reaches a query |
| Privilege escalation | Role read server-side from `authorized_users` only; admin routes can't be reached by a USER regardless of client claims; admins can't modify their own role/status via the API (self-lockout guard, not a bypass) |
| Fake admin requests / manipulated API calls | Every admin route independently calls `requireAdmin()`; RLS double-checks at the DB layer |
| Leaked/shared video URLs | Playback URL is only ever issued to an authenticated, allowlisted user via a rate-limited route — accepted trade-off: the issued URL itself has no expiry/domain lock (see §2.3), so a member could still copy-paste it onward |
| Brute-force / abuse | Rate limiting on auth callback, admin mutations, and playback-token issuance |
| Malicious query params / input | Zod validation on every admin-writable field (emails, URLs restricted to https, string length caps) |
| Exposed environment variables | Service-role key isolated to one file (`lib/supabase/admin.ts`), never `NEXT_PUBLIC_`-prefixed, never sent to the client |
| Insecure DB rules | RLS enabled on every table, deny-by-default, security-definer helper functions for role checks |
| Account sharing (one login, many people) | Per-account IP+device allowlist (§2.8), enforced on every request AND re-checked periodically during active video playback, not just at sign-in |

## 4. Security testing checklist

**Unauthorized (no session):**
- [ ] `/learn` → redirects to `/login`
- [ ] `/admin` → redirects to `/login`
- [ ] `/learn/board/<real-id>` → redirects to `/login`
- [ ] `/learn/video/<real-id>` → redirects to `/login`
- [ ] `curl /api/boards` → `401`
- [ ] `curl -X POST /api/video/<id>/play` → `401`
- [ ] Sign in with a Google account **not** on the allowlist → `login?error=access_denied`, no session persists afterward

**Authorized USER:**
- [ ] Sign in with an allowlisted email → lands on `/learn`
- [ ] Can open published boards/pages/videos
- [ ] Cannot open unpublished boards directly by ID (not-found, not an error revealing they exist)
- [ ] `/admin` → redirected to `/learn`
- [ ] `curl /api/admin/users` with their session → `403`

**ADMIN:**
- [ ] Can reach `/admin`, manage users and boards
- [ ] Can publish/unpublish, create/delete boards
- [ ] `curl -X POST /api/admin/users` with their session → `201`

**Removed/disabled user:**
- [ ] Admin disables the user
- [ ] Their existing browser session immediately fails `getAuth()` on the next request (verify by hitting `/learn` or `/api/boards` again without re-logging-in)
- [ ] Direct board/video URLs → denied
- [ ] `/api/video/:id/play` → `403`, no signed URL issued

**IDOR:**
- [ ] Take a valid board ID you can access, increment/mutate it → not-found, not the neighboring board's content
- [ ] Send a non-UUID string as an ID to any `[id]` route → `400`/`404`, no server error/stack trace

## 5. Known limitations / next steps

- **Rate limiting is in-memory** — replace with Upstash Redis for real
  multi-instance production traffic (see `lib/rateLimit.ts`).
- **Per-class download link**: each class has its own optional
  `download_url` field (set in `/admin/videos`, shown as a distinct
  "Download" button on the class page) — separate from the general
  Resources list, since it's one dedicated link per class rather than a
  named collection.
- **Multiple parts per board**: a board (chapter) can hold more than one
  class — Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, each with its own thumbnail and
  resources. Set the "Part number" field in `/admin/videos` to control
  order. Opening the board takes a member straight to the first part; a
  "Parts" list appears below the player whenever a board has more than
  one, letting them jump between parts without leaving the class.
- **Admin UI covers Users, Boards, and Classes** — create, edit,
  publish/unpublish, upload thumbnails, and attach/remove classes and
  their resources (Lecture Sheet, Exam Sheet, Practice Sheet, or any
  other named link — see `video_resources` in the schema). Editing an
  existing board or class is done via the **Edit** button on its row in
  `/admin/boards` or `/admin/videos`. The **Pages** editor (the
  "Board → Page → Board" intermediate layer) is fully defined and
  RLS-protected in `supabase/schema.sql` but doesn't yet have a
  dedicated admin UI — today, building a Page and its `page_boards`
  links is done via the Supabase table editor.
### 2.6 Video provider

- **Video provider**: Bunny Stream only — this is intentional, not a
  placeholder. One provider, one code path (`app/api/video/[id]/play/route.ts`),
  fewer ways for a mistake to slip through. If you ever need a second
  provider, add a new branch there rather than reintroducing a generic
  "provider" abstraction.
- **Browser playback cannot stop screen recording** — documented, not
  solvable, by design scoped to preventing account/link-level leakage.

## 6. Android App

NexSecurity ships as a native Android app — a [Trusted Web
Activity](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/trusted-web-activity)
(full-screen Chrome, no address bar; not a separate codebase or a
different auth model — every request from the app hits the exact same
server-side checks as the website). Built via
[Bubblewrap](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/bubblewrap), signed and
released automatically by `.github/workflows/build-android.yml`.

<!-- ANDROID_DOWNLOAD_LINK_START -->

[⬇ Download latest APK (build #11)](https://github.com/nexerisltd/NexSecurity-Website/releases/download/android-build-11/app-release-signed.apk)

<!-- ANDROID_DOWNLOAD_LINK_END -->

Every successful run of that workflow:
1. Builds and signs a release `.apk` + `.aab` with the keystore in repo
   secrets (never committed).
2. Publishes them as a new GitHub Release (tag `android-build-<run
   number>`).
3. Rewrites the download link above to point at that release and commits
   the change — so this README always links to the latest build with no
   manual step.

**To trigger a new build:** Actions tab → **Build Android App** → **Run
workflow**.

**One-time project setup** (already done for this repo — `twa-manifest.json`
is committed at the repo root, and the signing keystore is base64-encoded
in the `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` / `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` /
`ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` / `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` repo secrets) is documented
in `android/README.md`, including why it has to be done once,
interactively, via GitHub Codespaces rather than fully from CI.
